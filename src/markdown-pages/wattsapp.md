### OTK Studio partnered with Reggie Watts to create WattsApp, an app that stands as the digital manifestation of Mr. Watts himself. Critical to this translation was the need for a digital platform that allowed Reggie to communicate emotions, thoughts and content with few, if any, limitations. The result is an app that supports the idea of Reggie as 'the curator' and the platform as 'the art gallery', with the framework built specially to scale and adapt with Reggie's imagination.
