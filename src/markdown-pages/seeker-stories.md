### Seeker Stories is a series of interviews and portraits that together represent Sphere's passion for people. Whilst the Sphere app does harness modern technology, the human connections made using Sphere are where the primary value for users is found. Seeker Stories talked to 10 guides and 10 seekers, giving them a space to speak openly about personal histories and the meaning they find through coaching. OTK Studio provided both the photographs and art direction for the project.
