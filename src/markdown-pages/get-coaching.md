### Sphere was created to democratise coaching and connect individuals with the right people to unlock their potential. Sphere's principal app provides an end-to-end experience that situates coaching in one location. From conversing with potential coaches to scheduling and experiencing powerful sessions, the app facilitates the coaching experience from beginning to beyond.

This product was built internally alongside the incredible team at Sphere, from 2018 to Present. Oliver's role includes product design, strategy and art direction.
