### Mortal's identity references the Maranasati, a traditional Buddhist practice that was the impetus to build Mortal. One Maranasati contemplation takes you through a visualisation of the decomposition of your corpse, we represent this in the typography of the Mortal logotype, masterfully designed and set by [Justin Hunt Sloane](https://www.justinsloane.com).
