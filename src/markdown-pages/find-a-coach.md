### At Sphere we know that finding a coach is the primary boundary between intrigue and action. So, we created a digital platform that works in harmony alongside the Sphere app, empowering users to find their best-fit coaches whilst simultaneously leveraging best practices to deepen our search engine optimisation and conversion funnel.

This product was built internally alongside the incredible team at Sphere, from 2019 to Present. Oliver's role includes art direction, strategy and design & photography.
